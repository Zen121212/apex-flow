```bash
# API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Agent Orchestrator
curl http://localhost:3002/health

# Hugging Face Models
curl http://localhost:3002/hf-health

# Vector Storage
curl http://localhost:3002/vector-health
```

### Step 3: Create Test User (if authentication is required)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@apexflow.ai",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'
```

Get login token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@apexflow.ai",
    "password": "testpassword123"
  }'
```

Save the returned token for subsequent requests.

### Step 4: Upload a Document

#### Option A: File Upload (Multipart)
```bash
# Create a test PDF or text file
echo "This is a sample document about ApexFlow.

ApexFlow is an AI-powered document processing platform that uses Hugging Face models for text extraction, chunking, and intelligent question answering.

The system can process PDFs, extract text, generate embeddings, and provide accurate answers to questions about the document content.

- PDF text extraction
- Smart text chunking
- Vector embeddings with Hugging Face
- Semantic search and retrieval
- AI-powered question answering

ApexFlow is built with microservices architecture including API Gateway, Document Processing Workers, and AI Agent Orchestrator." > sample_document.txt

# Upload document
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@sample_document.txt" \
  -F "autoProcess=true"
```

#### Option B: Simple Upload (JSON)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/documents/simple-upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "originalName": "sample_document.txt",
    "mimeType": "text/plain",
    "size": 1024,
    "content": "This is a sample document about ApexFlow. ApexFlow is an AI-powered document processing platform that uses Hugging Face models for text extraction, chunking, and intelligent question answering. The system can process PDFs, extract text, generate embeddings, and provide accurate answers to questions about the document content."
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "documentId": "64f7a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  "filename": "sample_document.txt",
  "size": 1024,
  "mimeType": "text/plain",
  "processingJobId": "bull_1234567890_process-document",
  "message": "Document uploaded and queued for processing"
}
```

### Step 5: Monitor Document Processing

Check document list:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Get specific document:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/documents/YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Step 6: Wait for Processing to Complete

Processing typically takes 30-60 seconds depending on document size. Monitor logs in the pdf-workflows terminal for:

```
‚úÖ Document processing completed successfully
üìä Generated embedding with 384 dimensions
üìö Stored document chunks: 5 chunks, 5 embeddings
```

### Step 7: Ask Questions About Your Document

Once processing is complete, you can ask questions:

```bash
# Ask a specific question
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is ApexFlow?"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "query": "What is ApexFlow?",
  "answer": "ApexFlow is an AI-powered document processing platform that uses Hugging Face models for text extraction, chunking, and intelligent question answering.",
  "citations": [
    {
      "documentId": "64f7a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
      "title": "Document 64f7a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
      "excerpt": "ApexFlow is an AI-powered document processing platform that uses Hugging Face models...",
      "score": 0.95,
      "pageNumber": null
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-02T20:30:45.123Z"
}
```

### Step 8: More Advanced Queries

```bash
# Complex question
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are the main features of ApexFlow?"
  }'

# Technical question
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/qa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What architecture does ApexFlow use?"
  }'

# Summarize content
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Your long document text here...",
    "maxLength": 150
  }'
```

## üìä Testing Different File Types

### PDF Upload
```bash
# Assuming you have a PDF file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "autoProcess=true"
```

### Word Document (if supported)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.docx" \
  -F "autoProcess=true"
```
